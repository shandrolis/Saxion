//Write a program that reads a file containing text. Read each line and send it to the
//        output file, preceded by line numbers. If the input file is
//        Mary had a little lamb
//        Whose fleece was white as snow.
//        And everywhere that Mary went,
//        The lamb was sure to go!
//        then the program produces the output file
// /* 1 */ Mary had a little lamb
///* 2 */ Whose fleece was white as snow.
///* 3 */ And everywhere that Mary went,
///* 4 */ The lamb was sure to go!
//        The line numbers are enclosed in /* */ delimiters so that the program can be used for
//        numbering Java source files.
//        Prompt the user for the input and output file names.

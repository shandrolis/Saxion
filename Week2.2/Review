R8.11
basically the 'main' method; it is ran the moment the class is created

R8.12
infinite.
yes/no; if no constructor is made manually, it will be autogenerated (but empty) by the compiler.
that depends on what arguments are supplied when creating the class

R8.16
you cant access a variable/method directly if it is classified as Private

R8.17
Possibly. during normal use its count should only be changed by adding/removing certain bills/coins,
 however, at times a cash-register clerk might want to correct the amount.

R8.19
it refers to a variable from the class itself (e.a. this.count;)

R8.20
zero = an int/double containing the data that implies the number 'zero'
null = nothing is contained in the data of this variable
false = a boolean state
empty string = a functioning String variable that contains data that amounts to 'nothing'


Wat	is	het	verschil	tussen	static	en	non-static?
static methods can be called without a need for the class to be created
